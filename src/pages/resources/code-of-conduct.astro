			<h3>A note from the organizers</h3>
			<p>
				We welcome you to join our events organized by FOSSIA community, Telegram groups,
				collaborate on GitHub, follow up on social media or e-mail with an intention to learn,
				connect and explore the free software ecosystem in a respectful and kind manner.
			</p>
			<p>
				Our objective is to create a supportive environment for people from underrepresented
				backgrounds (which includes women, people with disabilities (PwDs), racial, ethnic,
				religious, gender minorities and economically weaker section (EWS)) to get involved in the
				free software ecosystem. As a women-centric community, we welcome everyone (including men
				and allies) who supports our values towards inclusion and development of the free software
				ecosystem. To adhere to our goals of ensuring inclusion and equity, some events and spaces
				will be reserved exclusively for women and people from underrepresented backgrounds.
			</p>
			<p>
				To maintain the spirits of the community and inclusive environment, we expect everyone, be
				it attendees, speakers, sponsors, project contributors, maintainers, members, and
				volunteers, to adhere to the Code of Conduct.
			</p>
			<p>
				We expect cooperation from everyone to ensure that our community remains a safe and
				welcoming place for everyone.

				</li>
			</ul>

			<p>
				Our community events, public communication and collaboration channels prohibits

			<h3>A longer version</h3>
			<p>
				Harassment includes but is not limited to offensive verbal or non-verbal comments related to
				gender, gender identity and expression, age, sexual orientation, disability, physical
				appearance, body size, race, ethnicity, religion, technology choices, sexual images in
				public spaces, deliberate intimidation, stalking, following, harassing photography or
				recording, sustained disruption of the event, inappropriate physical contact, unwelcome
				sexual attention and stereotyping in our event spaces, public communication, collaboration
				and social forums.
			</p>
			<p>
				Participants asked to stop any such behaviour are expected to comply immediately. If a
				participant engages in harassing behaviour despite being asked to stop such behaviour, the
				FOSSIA team will take an appropriate action, including warning the offender or expulsion
				from the event or online communication and collaboration spaces to ensure the safety of
				participants.
			</p>
			<p>
				The code of conduct and anti-harassment policies apply to everyone participating in the
				event including attendees, maintainers, contributors, sponsors, speakers, judges, mentors,
				volunteers, organisers, and FOSSIA members.
			</p>
			<p>
				Regardless of the event being a virtual or online-only event, we expect participants to
				adhere to these rules at all avenues, online and offline alike.
			</p>
			<p>
				Similarly, we expect participants to adhere to the code of conduct in our online
				collaboration, social and communication forums.
			</p>
			<p>
				For events that are only for people from underrepresented backgrounds, we limit
				participation from the same to ensure equity and inclusion. If an attendee has registered
				for an event but does not belong to an underrepresented background, they will not be
				permitted to attend the event and are expected to comply with the same.
