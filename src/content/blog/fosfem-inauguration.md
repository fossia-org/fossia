FOSFEM is proud to announce the inauguration of our community at Chennai Institute of Technology, marking the beginning of an exciting journey to empower and encourage women to develop the Indian free software ecosystem!  

## Event remarks

The event was an insightful one with Mr. Hari Prasanth as the Chief Guest, who explained about free and open-source software in a concise manner to 150 participants. This was followed by a rapid ideation round which challenged participants to form teams and ideate a free software solution with proper licensing.
